# Understanding mircoservices

## Microservice Overiew 
Microservices are a software development technique that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

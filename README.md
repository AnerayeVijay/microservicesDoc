# Understanding mircoservices

## What are microservices? 
- Microservices are a software development technique that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
- In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.
- Microservices follow the principles of service-oriented architecture (SOA) design
  They are as follows:
    -  Standardized service contract (services follow a standardized description)
    -  Loose coupling (minimal dependencies)
    -  Service abstraction (services hide their internal logic)
    -  Service reusability (service structure is planned according to the DRY principle)
    -  Service autonomy (services internally control their own logic)
    -  Service statelessness (services donâ€™t persist state from former requests)
